<!-- Html semantic tags are to increase the readability of websites. There is an emphasis on them instead of slapping together a bunch of <div> elements. I like header and footer a lot because those elements should be static in their set location.

I believe the browser displays html elements from top to bottom, or that's how it reads them. So scripts and css should go in the head, before the body since they affect the look of the page.

I learned sublime 2 does not include the DOCTYPE while sublime 3 does include it. I loved learning how to create snippets and am excited to create my own custom layouts in the future. The ability to generate a layout so quickly is great!

This was my first time seeing snippets so I initially had trouble reading the sample snippet. I would like to spend more time seeing other snippets people have created to see other possibilities. -->
