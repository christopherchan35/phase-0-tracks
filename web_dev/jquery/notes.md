##Release 0: Make a plan
1. I will be using google and search for things like "Introduction to JQuery" or "Beginner's tutorial of JQuery". I find that video tutorials are really useful when learning new languages or concepts.
2. Since this timebox will be 2 hours, a break in the middle might be good. I think testing what I learned will happen as I usually try to code along or try examples. But every 25-30 minutes I should check in and see what I've learned thus far.
