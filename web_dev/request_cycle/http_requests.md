##2. What are some common HTTP status codes?
The really common ones are 200 - OK, 403 - Forbidden, 404 - Not Found, 500 - Internal Server Error, 502 - Bad Gateway, 503 - Service Unavailable off the top of my head. After doing more research, other common ones include 301 - Moved Permanently, 302 - Found, 400 - Bad Request, 401 -Unauthorized, 550 - Permission Denied.

##3. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
The difference between a GET request and a POST request is that the GET requests data from a specified source while the POST submits data to be processed to a specified source. They are both request headers and considered to be 'methods' but not the same kind as a Ruby method.

##4. What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
A cookie is a text file that is stored in a user's machine or device. It allows the web page or server to store information locally and send it back when requests are made to it. It is used to remember stateful information or record a user's browsing activity.
